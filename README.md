## Problem statement

The sales director of the company is facing a lot of issues in terms of understanding how the business is performing <br>
and what are all the problem company is facing currently as the sales are not as expected and declining gradually <br>
And whenever he calls the regional managers to get the current status of the sales and market, as a human behaviour,
these people sugar cote the truth and send tons of Excel files instead of disclosing the truth, which made the sales director more frustrated.
Humans are not comfortable in consuming numbers from excel files, which is obvious reason for the frustration. <br>

## Solution

Sales director of the Adventure-Works company decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data <br>
into visual representation to make data driven decisions. so that top management means decision maker of this company can<br>
easily see the data based on visualization reports & then make the informed decisions. <br>
So, he hired a team of data people to complete this task. So the following tasks are given below 

- `Tasks`
    - [x] which products are begin preferred by customers
    - [x] which products are returned a lot
    - [x] which shops are doing good
    - [x] year on year comparison
